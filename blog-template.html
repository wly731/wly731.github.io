How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
It was hard to find an ideal collaboration tool to work on the wireframing. We just used Google slides. However, we both worked pretty well since the wireframing for the blog post is not that sophiticated.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
Yes, It is like drafting the framework and we can test the appearance by showing to others first before we actually have to code. In this way it is more systematic and efficient.


What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
We decided to have header and body. In the header we have a navigation bar while in the body part we have the bread crumbs showing where we are at currently, the post title, the time stamp and the post content.


What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
n/a
