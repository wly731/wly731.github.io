  <h1>Ruby Hashes vs. JavaScript Objects</h1>
  <h2>Similarities and differences between Ruby and JavaScript</h2>
  <h4>14 February 2016</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
      As you progress to JavaScript from Ruby, you would probably realize that both languages actually share quite a bit of similarities. As long as you practice with the JavaScript syntax, you can actually apply the same logic from Ruby in JavaScript. In this post I will talk about one of the major differences between Ruby and JavaScript - Ruby Hashes vs. JavaScript Objects
    </p>

    <br>

    <h4>Ruby hashes</h4>

    <p>
      In Ruby, you define a hash in this way:
    </p>

    <p>
      <pre><code>athlete = { height: 180, weight: 90, sport: basketball}</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>And you access different values like this:</p>

    <p>
      <pre><code>athlete[:height] #=> 190</code></pre>
      <pre><code>athlete[:weight] #=> 90</code></pre>
      <pre><code>athlete[:sport] #=> "basketball"</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      In Ruby hashes declaration, we need to define both hash keys and the corresponding hash values. In the above example we use symbol as the data type of hash keys.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h4>JavaScript Objects</h4>

    <p>In JavaScript, instead of using a hash, we create an object like this:</p>

    <p>
      <pre><code>var athlete = { height: 180, weight: 90, sport: basketball};</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>And you access different values of the properties like this:</p>


    <p>
      <pre><code>athlete.height / athlete["height"]   #=> 190</code></pre>
      <pre><code>athlete.weight / athlete["weight"] #=> 90</code></pre>
      <pre><code>athlete.sport / athlete["sport"] #=> "basketball"</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>As you may notice I have mentioned the word "property". Yes, in JavaScript everything is an object, and you can assign properties to different objects. In this case, instead of understanding it as a hash, we should rather say that we created an object called "athlete", which has 3 properties: "height", "weight" and "sport".</p>
