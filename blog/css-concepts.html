  <h1>CSS concept clinic - Box Model</h1>
  <h2>What is the difference between margin, border, and padding?</h2>
  <h4>17th January 2016</h4>

      CSS is a very important partner of HTML. When HTML does all the content and structuring, CSS adds all the colors to your website by letting you do all the styling and formatting. Today we are going to explore more on one of the important concepts in CSS - Box Model.
    </p>
    <p>
        First and foremost, all HTML elements can actually be considered as boxes. In CSS, box model is basically a box that frames every HTML element and is consisting of Margins, Borders, Padding and Content (from outermost to innermost)
    </p>
    <p>
        This image from w3schools shows a clear illustration of the box model:
        <br><br>
        <img src="../imgs/box-model.gif", />
    </p>

    <p>
        Having looked at the box model as a whole, let's look into the components one by one.
    </p>

    <h4>Content</h4>
    This is where the main content located in the entire box model. Content includes text and images

    <h4>Padding</h4>
    This is the transparent spacing between the content and the border. Adding padding makes the box model looks less packed.

    <h4>Border</h4>
    This is a line wrapping around the padding and the content. It gives you a sense of "box"

    <h4>Margin</h4>
    This is the transparent spacing outside the border. It is between the border and the next HTML element near it.

    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
      With all the differences between Padding, Border and Margin illustrated above, there is one common point. For all 3 of them, they can all be broken down into top, right, bottom and left segments. When you are defining the attributes of them you always want to specify which segment you are editing e.g. margin-left: 1px;.
