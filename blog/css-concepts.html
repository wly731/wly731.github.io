  <h1>CSS concept clinic - Box Model</h1>
  <h2>What is the difference between margin, border, and padding?</h2>

      CSS is a very important partner of HTML. When HTML does all the content and structuring, CSS adds all the colors to your website by letting you do all the styling and formatting. Today we are going to explore more on one of the important concepts in CSS - Box Model.
    </p>
    <p>
        First and foremost, all HTML elements can actually be considered as boxes. In CSS, box model is basically a box that frames every HTML element and is consisting of Margins, Borders, Padding and Content (from outermost to innermost)
    </p>
    <p>
        This image from w3schools shows a clear illustration of the box model:
        <br><br>
        <img src="../imgs/box-model.gif", />
    </p>

    <p>
        Having looked at the box model as a whole, let's look into the components one by one.
    </p>

    <h4>Content</h4>
    This is where the main content located in the entire box model. Content includes text and images

    <h4>Padding</h4>
    This is the transparent spacing between the content and the border. Adding padding makes the box model looks less packed.

    <h4>Border</h4>
    This is a line wrapping around the padding and the content. It gives you a sense of "box"

    <h4>Margin</h4>
    This is the transparent spacing outside the border. It is between the border and the next HTML element near it.

    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
      With all the differences between Padding, Border and Margin illustrated above, there is one common point. For all 3 of them, they can all be broken down into top, right, bottom and left segments. When you are defining the attributes of them you always want to specify which segment you are editing e.g. margin-left: 1px;.

How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
It was hard to find an ideal collaboration tool to work on the wireframing. We just used Google slides. However, we both worked pretty well since the wireframing for the blog post is not that sophiticated.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
Yes, It is like drafting the framework and we can test the appearance by showing to others first before we actually have to code. In this way it is more systematic and efficient.


What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
We decided to have header and body. In the header we have a navigation bar while in the body part we have the bread crumbs showing where we are at currently, the post title, the time stamp and the post content.


What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
