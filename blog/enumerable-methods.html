  <h1>Ruby Enumerable methods</h1>
  <h2>One of the most basic enuemrable methods to loop through and change the content of your array or hash</h2>
  <h4>31st January 2016</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
      You may have already heard about looping. As a newbie the loop that you feel most comfortable with is probably while loop with a loop counter "i". However, if you want to iterate through an array or hash, there is actually a better way to do so. In this blog post, I will introduce you an enumerable method - <code>Enumerable#map</code>
    </p>

    <br>
    <h4>What does <code>#map</code> do?</h4>

    <p>
      <code>#map</code> is actually the same as <code>#collect</code>. What they do is to iterate through every element of the data type, run the code block on each of them, then return the new element. (or replace the original element with the new element if the destructive method is called, which is <code>#map!</code>) It is like remapping the original object through some transformation.
    </p>

    <br>
    <h4>How to use <code>#map</code>?</h4>

    <p>
      Here are a few examples:
    </p>

    <p>
      <code>num = [1,2,3,4]</code>
    </p>

    <p>
      <code>num.map{ |number| number*2 }    #=> [2,4,6,8]</code>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      <code> name = ["victor","wong"]</code>
    </p>

    <p>
      <code>name.map{ |name| name.capitalize }    #=> ["Victor","Wong"]</code>
    </p>

How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
It was hard to find an ideal collaboration tool to work on the wireframing. We just used Google slides. However, we both worked pretty well since the wireframing for the blog post is not that sophiticated.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
Yes, It is like drafting the framework and we can test the appearance by showing to others first before we actually have to code. In this way it is more systematic and efficient.


What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
We decided to have header and body. In the header we have a navigation bar while in the body part we have the bread crumbs showing where we are at currently, the post title, the time stamp and the post content.


What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
n/a
