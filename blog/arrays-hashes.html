  <h1>Arrays vs. Hashes</h1>
  <h2>New data types that can store a list of objects</h2>
  <h4>25 January 2016</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
      You may already know about some of the most basic data type, like integers, floats, strings etc. However, they can only hold one object at a time e.g. an integer type of variable can only hold ONE integer. You may wonder are there any other more complicated types of variable that can hold multiple objects, like a list? Sure it does! For this week let us go through 2 of the most common used data types can that hold multiple objects. They are Arrays and Hashes.
    </p>

    <h4>Arrays</h4>

    <p>
      Array can be considered as list. It can hold multiple number of objects and access them using an index number. A simple 2D array can be defined as:
    </p>

    <p>
      <pre><code>sample-array = [1,2,'Hello']</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      And the element can be called in the following ways:
    </p>

    <p>
      <pre><code>sample-array[0] => 1</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      <pre><code>sample-array[1] => 2</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      <pre><code>sample-array[2] => Hello</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>

    </p>

    <p>
      From this simple example you may already guess that a simple 2D array works like a list of boxes, where each of them can contain a number, a character, a string or even another array (a 3D array). The boxes are numbered with  ascending index numbers starting at 0.

    <h4>Hashes</h4>

    <p>Similar to Arrays, Hashs are also lists of information that can store multiple objects. However, one significant difference from Arrays is that, objects stored in Hashes are not referenced with ordered index numbers. Instead, the references of the objects in Hashes are called "keys", of which the name can be freely defined. Hence, Hashes can also be considered as a collection of information pairs.</p>

    <p>Hashes can be defined as:</p>

    <p><pre><code>sample-hash = {"John Smith" => 2, "Lisa Smith" => 1, "Sam Doe" => 4, "Sandra Dee" => 14}</code></pre></p>

    <p>And the elements can be called in the following ways:</p>

    <p><pre><code>sample-hash["John Smith"] => 1</code></pre></p>

    <p><pre><code>sample-hash["Lisa Smith"] => 2</code></pre></p>

    <p><pre><code>sample-hash["Sam Doe"] => 4</code></pre></p>

    <p><pre><code>sample-hash["Sandra Dee"] => 14</code></pre></p>

    <p>To conclude, although Arrays and Hashes behave similarly in a sense that they both store a list of objects, they are different since Array objects are referenced with order index numbers while Hash objects are referenced with user-defined keys. If you want to store a list of ordered objects, Arrays are prefered; If you want to store a list of logically paired information, then Hashes are preferred.</p>
