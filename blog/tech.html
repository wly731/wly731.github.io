  <h1>What is Rails?</h1>
  <h2></h2>
  <h4>20 Feb 2016</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
      Ruby on Rails, or simply called Rails, was created by David Heinemeier Hansson in 2005. It is a software code added to the Ruby programming language.
    </p>

    <p>
      Rails is a framework for building websites. As such, Rails establishes conventions for easier collaboration and maintenance. Learning Rails means learning how to use the Rails conventions and its API. For example, there are 4 major Rails philosophy or guiding principles:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Don't Repeat Yourself</b>: DRY is a principle of software development which states that "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system." By not writing the same information over and over again, our code is more maintainable, more extensible, and less buggy.</li>

      <br>

      <li><b>Convention Over Configuration</b>: Rails has opinions about the best way to do many things in a web application, and defaults to this set of conventions, rather than require that you specify every minutiae through endless configuration files.</li>

      <br>

      <li><b>Rails is Opinionated</b>: Rails is said to be “opinionated.” There is a “Rails way” for many of the problems that must be solved by a web application developer. If you follow the Rails conventions, you’ll have fewer decisions to make and you’ll find more of what you need is already built. The benefit is faster development, improved collaboration, and easier maintenance. The downside is lower flexibility. If you persist in bringing old habits from other languages to your Rails development, and trying to use patterns you learned elsewhere, you may have a less happy experience.
      </li>

      <br>

      <li><b>Rails is Omakase</b>: Omakase is a Japanese phrase that means “I’ll leave it to you.” Heinemeier Hansson declared Rails is Omakase, and said, “A team of chefs picked out the ingredients, designed the APIs, and arranged the order of consumption on your behalf according to their idea of what would make for a tasty full-stack framework. Understanding that Rails is omakase means accepting that many of the opinions enshrined in the Rails API are the decisions of a small number of leading developers, after they have undergone thorough discussion and made significant contributions to the Rails code base. For the most part, Heinemeier Hansson’s “opinions” will serve you well.

      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Rails combine the Ruby language with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a web application that runs on a web server. Because it runs on a web server, Rails is considered as a server-side, or “back end” web application development platform (the web browser is the "front end”). A web development framework like Rails is needed to build complex websites.
    </p>

    <p>
      We just covered some very brief facts about Rails. In the future we will explore Rails in greater depth to see how it actually works to help contructing a complex website.
