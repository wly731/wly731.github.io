  <h1>Week 9 - Jekyll</h1>
  <h2>A powerful blogging framework</h2>
  <h4>29 Feb 2016</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
      Jekyll is a really powerfull blogging framework, where you can build your own framework and then reuse it everytime so that you don't have to actually type all the code all over again. Every time you do a blog post you can just focus on the content
    </p>

    <p>
      This week I have learned how to set up my website using Jekyll. I also tried to use one of the Jekyll templates out there and played around it in order to get familiar with the Jekyll documentation. It was so tempting to use those well-designed ready-to-use templates, but I ended up redesigning my CSS again and I really had fun with it.
    </p>

    <p>
      After looking at different templates, I have better idea on how I want my site to look like, I am looking forward to starting phase 1 tomorrow as I can't wait to further improve my site!
