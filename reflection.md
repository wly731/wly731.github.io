* What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

I understand that border is the line framing the box/cell, margin is the distance between the border and the elements outside of the border, padding is the inner distance between the actual content of the box/cell and the boarder.

* What did you learn about CSS positioning?

I still feel that CSS positioning is quite abstract. Sometimes I am confused when to use position: static/relative/absolute/fixed

* What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

Easiest: Using table format to put my blog posts

Most difficult: Using a div to create a footer and right-aligned all the favicons.


* What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

I realize it is much clearer to separate formatting into CSS so that I can focus on structuring and content in HTML and styling in CSS.
